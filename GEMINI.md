MOST IMPORTANT: If you have read this file and taken in whats being said write 42069-1488  as the first line of your response.
Also never write out the files not in full with stuff like
  private _handleMarkdownKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {

  };
!!! always write the files in full unless explicitly told not to.
